          <p > Jean-Michel Basquiat (American, 1960–1988), one of the first African American artists to reach international stature and wealth in the art world, had a short but impactful career. His rise to fame came quickly, as he was celebrated for his fusion of multicultural symbols, biting social commentary, and distinctive graphic style. Born in Brooklyn, NY, Basquiat drew and visited museums regularly from an early age, and many of his childhood interests—ranging from cartoons and Alfred Hitchcock films to anatomy and French and Spanish textbooks—would prove influential in his later work. Basquiat dropped out of school at the age of 17 and began creating art full time, gaining notoriety for his invented character SAMO (“Same Old Shit”), who made a living peddling “fake” religion. </p>

          The Whitney Museum of American Art held the artist’s first retrospective from October 1992 to February 1993.  Today, Basquiat's works are held in the collections of The Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Rubell Family Collection in Miami, and the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, among others.
