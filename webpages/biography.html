      <h2> Biography of Basquiat </h2>
      <p> Basquiat's art was as unique as it was extraordinary - forming a rare bond between street art and the institutions of the international art world.
      Basquiat was categorised within the Neo-Expressionism art movement, an umbrella capturing all manner of contemporary artists.<p>
      <p>
      This young American cited Pop Art and Expressionism as his main influences, with Andy Warhol a personal friend.
      Basquiat was also politically motivated and wanted to make use of his rare priviledge of being a successful Afro-Caribbean artist whose voice would be heard.
      The use of symbolism with graffiti art is particularly in vogue in the present day, thanks to the popularity and high profile status of UK artist, Banksy.<p>
      <p>
      Basquiat's rejection of the mainstream fitted perfectly with in the Punk scene of New York. The style of art used there was also wildly expressive and abstract.
      In fact, this was an artist who carefully drew together all manner of items into his symbolic artwork. Manic was not the state of his mind as he put together these busy compositions - despite how the final paintings may have looked.</p>
      <p>Basquiat was a creative talent, always looking for new avenues in which to take his ideas and passion. Prior to establishing himself as a renowned mainstream painter, Jean-Michel was a poet, musician and graffiti artist around the streets of New York. He also took some inspiration for his collages from prominent artist Robert Rauschenberg, who was establishing his own reputation around the same time.
      </p>  <p>
      The rise and fall of Basquiat during the 80s underlines the commercial exaggerations experienced by successful artists at that time. Hype and publicity boosted and destroyed many a career at this time. Only those who remain popular today had the talent to back it up. </p>
